# gesturekit-android

> An Android library to recognize gestures on Android apps.

## Compatibility
- Android Froyo (2.2, API level 8) or higher.

##Usage
### Import jar files into your project.
[Download](http://learn.gesturekit.com/download/download_file/GestureKit-android-1.0.2.jar) and add it to your project's build path.
If you are working on Gingerbread MR1 or lower you must [download jackson library](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) and then include it in your build path.


### Create GestureKit Service.
Edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines of code.
```java
<service android:name="com.roamtouch.gesturekit.communications.GestureKitService"></service>
```

### Instance a GestureKit object.
You must create it using your host Activity and your `GID`. GestureKit object should be paused and resumed. For example:
```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity{
    ...
    private GestureKit gestureKit;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...
        this.gestureKit = new GestureKit(this, [a valid GID]);
        ...
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onResume(){
        super.onResume();
        gestures.onResume();
    }

    @Override
    public void onPause(){
        super.onPause();
        gestures.onPause();
    }
}
```

###  Setup GestureKit
There two ways to bind gestures with actions: Matching Name Method (MNM) or `GKActionInterface MNM`: you should declare a method with the same name of the defined GestureKit method. For example, you define the `PLAY` method, then you should declare:

```java
public void PLAY(){
...
}
```

### GKActionInterface
Consists in declare an object implementing `GKActionInterface`. This interface is defined as follows:
```java
public interface GKActionInterface {
    public String getActionID();
    public void onGestureRecognized(Object... params);
}
```
`getActionID` returns method name. 
`onGestureRecognized` has the code to be called when the gesture is recognized.

an example:

```java
public class MyAction implements GKActionInterface {
    public String getActionID(){
        return "PLAY";
    }
    public void onGestureRecognized(Object... params){
        Log.i("gesture PLAY recognized!");
      //Let's do something cool
 }
}
```
You should consider that GKActionInterface's methods will be called before MNMs, so if you declare a GKActionInterface method with the same name as a MNM, MNM will not be called.

### Customizing GKVisor [optional].
GestureKit has a default visor called `GestureKitVisor`, it's responsible of show GestueKit status as `loading`, `drawing gestures`, `ready` and `warning`. For example, you define the `PLAY` method, then you should declare:

It can be replaced by your own Visor just implementing VisorInterface and then setting it to your GestureKit object calling setVisor method. VisorInterface is as follows:

```java
public interface VisorInterface {
    public void proccessTouchEvent(MotionEvent event);
    public void clear();
    public void showErrorLogo();
    public void showLoadingLogo();
    public void showOkLogo();
}
```

`proccessTouchEvent` method is used to draw current's gesture shape, it should receive all motion events generated by your UI. clear method is called after a gesture is finished, is called either if it is recognized or not.

`showErrorLogo` method is called after an error or warning are occured. For example, if you are offline or your `GID` is not valid.

`showLoadingLogo` method is called while a background process is executing. For example when GestrueKit is downloading data.

`showOkLogo` method is called every time GestureKit is ready.
