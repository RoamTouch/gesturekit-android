# Android Addon

An Android library to recognize advanced gestures on Android apps.

* * *

## Compatibility

###

Android Froyo (2.2, API level 8) or higher

* * *

## Usage

  

### 1 - Import jar files into your project

[Download](http://dev.gesturekit.com/download) and add it to your project's
build path.

If you are working on Gingerbread MR1 or lower you must download jackson
library from [[url de jackson]](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) and then include
it in your build path.

##

### 2 - GestureKit permissions

Edit your AndroidManifest.xml and add the following permissions

```java    
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

##

### 3 - Create GestureKit Service

Edit your AndroidManifest.xml and add the following lines of code.

```java        
    <service android:name="com.roamtouch.gesturekit.communications.GestureKitService" ></service>
```
##

### 4 - Instance a GestureKit object

You must create it using your host Activity and your GID. GestureKit object
should be paused and resumed. For example

```java      
    public class MyActivity extends Activity{
       ...
       private GestureKit gestureKit;
       
           @Override
           public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           ...
           this.gestureKit = new GestureKit(this, [a valid GID]);
           ...
       }
       
       @Override
       public void onResume(){
           super.onResume();
           this.gestureKit.onResume();
       }
       
       @Override
       public void onPause(){
           super.onPause();
           this.gestureKit.onPause();
       }
    }
```
  

##

### 5 - Setup GestureKit

There two ways to bind gestures with actions: Matching Name Method (MNM) or
GKActionInterface

**MNM:** you should declare a method with the same name of the defined GestureKit method. For example, you define the "PLAY" method, then you should declare: 

```java      
    public void PLAY(){
       ...
    }
```
  

##

### 6 - Creating a GestureAction plugin for GestureKit

You can create your own Gesture Actions for Android, the class you create will listen for a gesture to be recognized and will interface via GKActionInterface.

### Consists in declare an object implementing

### GKActionInterface

This interface is defined as follows:

```java      
    public interface GKActionInterface {
       public Vector getActionID();
       public void onGestureRecognized(Object... params);
    }
```

getActionID **returns method name.**

onGestureRecognized **has the code to be called when the gesture is
recognized.**

**an example:**

```java      
    public class MyAction implements GKActionInterface {
       public String getActionID() {
        return "PLAY";        
       }

       public void onGestureRecognized(Object... params){
           Log.i("gesture PLAY recognized!");
         //Let's do something cool
    }
   }
```

You should consider that GKActionInterface's methods will be called before
MNMs, so if you declare a GKActionInterface method with the same name as a
MNM, MNM will not be called.

##

### 7 - Customizing GKVisor [optional]

GestureKit has a default visor called **GestureKitVisor**, it's responsible of
show GestueKit status as "loading", "drawing gestures", "ready" and
"warning".ample, you define the "PLAY" method, then you should declare:

It can be replaced by your own Visor just implementing VisorInterface and then
setting it to your GestureKit object calling setVisor method. VisorInterface
is as follows:

```java      
    public interface VisorInterface {
       public void proccessTouchEvent(MotionEvent event);
       public void clear();
       public void showErrorLogo();
       public void showLoadingLogo();
       public void showOkLogo();
    }
```

**proccessTouchEvent** method is used to draw current's gesture shape, it should receive all motion events generated by your UI. clear method is called after a gesture is finished, is called either if it is recognized or not. 

**showErrorLogo** method is called after an error or warning are occured. For example, if you are offline or your GID is not valid. 

**showLoadingLogo** method is called while a background process is executing. For example when GestrueKit is downloading data. 

**showOkLogo** method is called every time GestureKit is ready.
